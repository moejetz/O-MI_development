'''
This is an IP management server, used with O-MI (https://github.com/AaltoAsia/O-MI).
It stores tuples of IP- and MAC addresses of Allnet All3073 outlets.
These outlets will inform this server every time their IP address change.
This is neccessary because the IP addresses will be assigned dynamically.
Therefore, in the O-MI node there will be stored only the MAC addresses, on which other instances can request the related IP addresses from this server.

This server is part of a project from Kary Fr√§mling.
The goal is to create a test implementation of O-MI for one room at the Aalto University,
to act as a reference implementation and base for further projects concerning room automation for the whole University.

Note: only works with python3, required dependencies: requests, bottle, bottle-sqlite
